# 🔄 Switch from Koyeb to Render

Koyeb has too many Prisma issues. Let's use Render instead - it's designed for apps like yours!

- ✅ **Auto-deploys** from GitHub

## 💡 What About Supabase?

You can still use your Supabase database if you want! Just update the DATABASE_URL in Render to use your Supabase connection string.

But Render's PostgreSQL is easier since it's built-in!
